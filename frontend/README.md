cd # Frontend — SELVAM MALIGAI STORE (Phase 4, customer-facing)

React 18 + Vite + Tailwind + Framer Motion. Talks to the real Phase 1
backend for auth (`/api/auth/*`); product/cart/order data is mocked in
`src/data/mockProducts.js` in the exact shape of the Phase 1 `products`
table, ready to swap for real API calls once Phase 2 ships.

## Design tokens

- **Palette**: curry-leaf green (`leaf`), turmeric gold (`turmeric`), kumkum
  red for sale badges (`kumkum`), rice white (`rice`) — grounded in the
  everyday materials of a South Indian provisions store rather than a
  generic storefront theme.
- **Type**: Baloo 2 (display, rounded/friendly), Inter (body), IBM Plex Mono
  (prices — tabular figures so digits don't jitter).
- **Signature**: a scalloped "banana-leaf edge" divider under the hero and
  echoed at the footer, instead of a plain rectangle section break.

## Run it

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev        # http://localhost:5173, proxies /api to :5000
```

Run the Phase 1 backend alongside it (`cd ../backend && npm run dev`) to
exercise real login/register — the rest of the homepage renders from mock
data until Phase 2's product API lands.

## Environment variables

Create a `.env` file in `frontend` or set Vercel environment variables from the
Dashboard. The frontend reads `VITE_API_BASE_URL` and falls back to `/api`.

Example `frontend/.env`:

```bash
VITE_API_BASE_URL=/api
```

Example for a separate deployed backend:

```bash
VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://your-backend-domain.vercel.app/api
```
